# Peta-Bytes
## Master Branch

Each class will be its own branch

### HTTP5206
### HTTP5204

Within the _HTTP5204_ branch, each feature will then be its own branch

_For Example: checkout HTTP5204 branch, then create a branch to complete feature, then push that feature branch to class branch_

This is done to avoid commit conflicts in Git.


### Test text file
For the practise file, it is located from the _HTTP 5204_ branch, and the branch is called _Test-text-file_. the text file is called _Peta.txt_. 

What you are adding is:
{your_name} — {your_email}
_Example_:
Bryan Stephens — n01171069@humbermail.ca
