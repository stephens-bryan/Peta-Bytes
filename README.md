## Master Branch

Each class will be its own branch

### HTTP5206
### HTTP5204

Within the _HTTP5204_ branch, each feature will then be its own branch

_For Example: checkout HTTP5204 branch, then create a branch to complete feature, then push that feature branch to class branch_

This is done to avoid commit conflicts in Git.
